                        <p> Chloeeeee I was so excited to finally put this together - don't ask me how long it took tho hahah. I hope you are clicking on the tabs in order because that's how I wanted it done. Anyways, this part is one of my favorites because it means I get to write down all of my favorite things about you : ) (that's a beaming emoji in case you're wondering)</p>
                        <p>Okay here's Chloe Yvonne Whitt in no particular order:</p>
                        <p>Chloe you are the most beautiful girl I have ever met, and I am not just saying that. I could go on and on about every single part of you, and lucky for you I am gonna give you a whole lot of examples:
                            <br>
                            1. Your perfect face. I mean c'mon, this is too easy to compliment. Your eyes are soooo freakin pretty, I honestly cannot get over them - and your eyelashes are cute to go along with them. Your smile is really perfect, I would not change a thing (not that I would change anything about you in general). Like, whether you show off your pearly whites or not, I love looking at your smile - it is addicting, makes me smile every time
                           <br>
                            2. Your hair. I hope that you know that I look at your hair every single time you turn around, I am not exaggerating. No matter how you do it, your hair looks amazing on you - although I especially love it when you curl it for our little date nights 
                            <br>
                            3. Your body. I was gonna keep complimenting every single body part individually but what's the fun in having you read an essay about what you get to look at every day (extremely jealous btw). So instead of that, I just wanted to say that you have a beautiful body Chloe. I mean obviously I find you extremely attractive every time I take a little peek (or just stare because I can't help myself). But some of my favorite parts about your body are your hands (you know how I feel about those and how badly I want them all over me), your pretty arms, your skinnyyyyy waist, your tiny stomach, your perfect hips, your sexy legs, and all the other perfect parts of you that I love to touch (including those that I probably shouldn't write out on here)
                        </p>
                        <p>That was literally just all about your physical appearance Chloe, and honestly I could've gone on for days. But I need to save some things for in person compliments about that haha, so here are some of my favorite qualities about you babe:
                            <br>
                            1. How selfless you are. I recently have been complimenting you about this a lot but I really think it is one of your most defining qualities Chloe, and I sure appreciate how good of an example you are to me. Although take a little bit of time to be selfish for yourself every once in a while. You really deserve it
                            <br>
                            2. Your ability to make everything in life fun. Chloe you got me laughing and enjoying every second of life that I am with you, that seriously is a talent that few have. No matter what we do, you make sure to make me have a good time.
                            <br>
                            3. Your testimony. I will always remember the night I asked you to share how you know that the Church is true. Your testimony that night really inspired me to keep in mind the important things Chloe, and I am forever grateful that the person I will spend the rest of my life with has an immovable rock as a testimony
                            <br>
                            4. Your laugh. This one includes how funny you are Chloe. I don't think I could go a full hour without you making me laugh - especially since your laugh is so contagious. It just reminds me of happiness tbh
                            <br>
                            5. Your intelligence 6. Your music taste 7. Your little dances when you're happy 8. Your determination to make others happy 9. Your hugs, kisses, and cuddles 10. Your ability to love 11. Your wedding planning skills 12. Your voice - singing, talking, doesn't matter I love it 13. Your little tears of joy when you are happy 14. Your ability to talk to anyone 15. Your back/head scratches...
                        </p>
                        <p> I have more I could write about, trust me. But there is so much more to you than would fit on this website so, hope you're okay with this short list - it does prove you're the best after all</p>
